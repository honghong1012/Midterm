# NU ce334 project (course only)

This is the Midterm project for course only.

## Project Suggestion
You need to run the project on your machines. **We strongly recommend Linux or Mac OS.** On Windows, some package referred by the project has bugs, and we recommend Ubuntu subsystem on Windows.

**We also strongly recommend you install a proper IDE** to make coding in Rust easier. Below are some good choices:
1. [IntelliJ Rust](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/). It is free for all _.edu_ email account, specially designed for Rust, and very easy to use.
2. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is totally free and very flexible. You need to install an [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) for the Rust language support. Extensions for coding on non-local machines (via WSL/SSH) are also available to download.
